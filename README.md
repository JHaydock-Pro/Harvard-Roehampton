*Other citations may work fine but have not been tested, they'll use the Havard-Anglia version as default.*

### Notes and Compromises
- Currently using multiple authors for citation results in a comma appearing after the last author, this is proving difficult to resolve *- I think I've fixed this, let me know if it still happens*
- For book editions, the default `ed.` is used rather than the Roehampton `edn.`
- Word makes no distinction between short and long author names, I would recomend using the short name for both in-text and bibliography citations (i.e. use 'STFC' instead of 'Science and Technology Facilities Council').
